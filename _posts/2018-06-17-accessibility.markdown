Before we start discussing why web accessibility is so important for your business, let’s dive into what it really is.

As a topic that we are very passionate about at Hey Nova, we have talked to a lot of people about it, and one thing we have learnt is while most people have a vague idea of what it is, very few people really understand it and why it is so important.

**Luckily, web accessibility is really easy to grasp once it is laid out.**

## What is web accessibility?

So if you know anything about web accessibility, you probably understand that it has something to do with making websites usable for people with blindness, requiring a screen reader to assist them in navigating the website. But it doesn’t end there.

It gives access to people with a range of disabilities and impairments. For instance, it can improve use for people with mobility restrictions that limit them from using a mouse,  it can be useful for people with changing abilities due to ageing, or it can help people with colorblindness. For instance, if the proper colour contrast is not used on a website, it can become unreadable to the percentage of the population with the inability to distinguish between the colours on your page.

**And that’s still not all. Web accessibility also helps people without limitations.**

For example, it makes it far easier for any person trying to view a website on smaller devices, including someone with large thumbs that struggles to press the buttons on a website. Then there are people with temporary limitations such as a broken arm, or even just someone who has lost their glasses. There is an extensive list of people that web accessibility makes your site usable for, that extends far past the normal understanding of its purpose.

So, while persons living with disabilities and impairments take up around [15%<sup>1</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref1) of the world's population, they are not the only clients you are likely losing by not building your website to meet accessibility standards.

Which moves us onto our second point.

## Why is web accessibility so important?

### 1. It’s the right thing to do… for your bottom line
Let’s begin with the most obvious one. It is the right thing to do. When you say that web accessibility is not important, you are saying that people with disabilities are not important. But in case that still isn’t enough to convince everyone, let’s take a different approach. When you say that web accessibility is not important, you are saying that their business is not important, and lost business is lost money.

### 2. Web accessibility is good user experience, which is good for everyone

In recent years you may have heard the term user experience rise in popularity. User experience is the practice of developing tech, or anything for that matter, with a user first approach. The benefits of including it in your website development are without a doubt worth every penny. Increased user experience means greater customer satisfaction, which translates to increased sales. A happy customer is a returning customer.

What very few people know is that web accessibility is just very good user experience, so this practice should stretch to users with disabilities or you are likely losing a great deal of money from excluding some of your clientele. And as we talked about previously, people with disabilities are not the only users you are excluding, so stop thinking of web accessibility as a separate thing but rather as the best user experience you can imagine, benefiting everyone that accesses your website.

### 3. It’s good for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

But the benefits don’t end there. Having your website built to be accessible is great for your SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Search engines parse through your site in a very similar way to that of screen readers. For instance, neither can make sense of graphical elements therefore proper labelling of images with alt tags is important, and both rely on document structure to navigate the page. So overall, websites that make accessibility improvements will also get a great SEO boost.

### 4. Many Provinces in Canada are passing laws to make it mandatory

If your business is located in British Columbia, Canada, you might be interested to know that the government is taking steps towards making it [law for all websites in the province to meet accessibility standards<sup>2</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref2).  And other provinces and territories, including Saskatchewan and Yukon, will likely be following suit. Meanwhile, Ontario is way ahead of the curb in technology and inclusivity, making it law in 2005 through the [Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)<sup>3</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref3).

### 5. Avoid lawsuits for not having an accessible website in the US

In America, an increasing number of lawsuits have been raised against American companies whose websites are not up to accessibility standards, reaching up to [814 reported cases in 2017<sup>4</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref4). While America has no specific laws requiring websites to be accessible, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, has two major sections that can be applied to web accessibility.
* [Title II<sup>5</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref5), which states that communications with persons with disabilities must be "as effective as communications with others" [28 C.F.R. ss 35.160 (a)] and
* [Title III<sup>6</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref6), which deals with public accommodation of people with disabilities.

So hopefully by this point, you are inspired to make your website accessible. At the end of the day, the cost of updating your website to accessibility standards is nothing compared to the money spent in lawsuits, or from losing good customers.

## How can I make sure my website is accessible?

If you are still in the early stages of building your website, this is the best time to make it accessible. Integrating it into the design and development right from the start is the most cost-effective option for any business, and I highly recommend every new organization and solo entrepreneur take this approach.

However, you may already have a website. In this case, there are options for checking whether your website is accessible by running it through tools such as [WAVE<sup>7</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref7) or [Sitemprov<sup>8</sup>](http://heynova.io/blog/accessibility/#ref8), but it should be noted that these applications will not catch all the accessibility errors. Your best option is to look for consultation from an expert.
